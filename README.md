Great question — this is *exactly* how many startup internships actually happen 👍
I’ll break this into a **clear, practical system** you can follow step-by-step.

---

## 1️⃣ Before You Even Search for Companies (prep work)

Before cold-emailing *anyone*, make sure these are ready:

### ✅ A **focused skill story**

You should be able to answer in **one sentence**:

> “I can help startups with **X** using **Y skills**.”

Examples:

* “I build React + Node dashboards for early-stage products.”
* “I automate data collection and analysis using Python.”
* “I design and deploy ML models for small datasets.”

If you try to sound “good at everything,” startups won’t respond.

---

### ✅ 2–4 **real projects**

Not tutorials. Not course certificates.

Each project should show:

* **Problem** → what you were trying to solve
* **Your solution** → tech stack + approach
* **Outcome** → what works / metrics / demo

Have at least **one** of these:

* GitHub repo (clean README)
* Live demo (Vercel, Netlify, Render, etc.)
* Short Loom video (1–2 min explanation)

---

### ✅ A simple **one-page resume**

No fancy design needed. Must include:

* Skills (only what you can actually use)
* Projects (with links)
* Education (brief)

---

## 2️⃣ How to Search for the Right Startups (very important)

### ❌ Don’t search:

* “Top startups”
* Big, famous companies
* Companies with formal internship pages

### ✅ Search for:

**Early-stage startups** (5–50 people)

---

### 🔍 Best places to find them

#### 1. **LinkedIn**

Search:

```
"Founder" AND "Building"
"Early stage startup"
"Stealth startup"
```

Then filter:

* Location (your target country)
* Company size: **1–10, 11–50**

---

#### 2. **Wellfound (AngelList Talent)**

Search by:

* Role (Frontend, Backend, ML, etc.)
* Stage: *Pre-seed, Seed*
* Team size: under 20

These founders *expect* cold outreach.

---

#### 3. **Twitter / X**

Search:

```
"we are building"
"just launched our startup"
"looking for engineers"
```

Founders here are very open to DMs/emails.

---

#### 4. **Product Hunt**

Look for:

* New products (launched in last 1–6 months)
* Small teams
* MVP-level products

---

## 3️⃣ Once You Find a Company → What to Research

This step decides whether they reply or ignore you.

### 🔎 You MUST know:

#### 1️⃣ What exactly they are building

Answer these:

* Who is the user?
* What problem are they solving?
* Is it B2B or B2C?

You should be able to explain their product in **2 lines**.

---

#### 2️⃣ Their tech stack (if possible)

Check:

* Careers page
* GitHub
* LinkedIn profiles of engineers

Search on Google:

```
"CompanyName" tech stack
"CompanyName" GitHub
```

---

#### 3️⃣ Where YOU can help

Ask yourself:

* Can I improve their frontend?
* Can I automate something?
* Can I build a small feature?
* Can I analyze data they probably have?

**Never say:** “I want to learn”
**Always say:** “I can help with ___”

---

## 4️⃣ Who to Email (not HR)

### ✅ Email:

* Founder
* Co-founder
* CTO
* Lead Engineer

### ❌ Avoid:

* HR
* “[careers@company.com](mailto:careers@company.com)”

Use:

* LinkedIn → About → Contact info
* Company website
* Hunter.io (if needed)

---

## 5️⃣ What Your Email Should Do (structure)

Your email must:

1. Be **short**
2. Show you understand *their* product
3. Show proof of your skills
4. Ask clearly for a **short summer internship**

---

### 🧠 Mental checklist before sending:

* Is this personalized?
* Did I mention *their* product?
* Did I link a project relevant to them?
* Is it under 150–180 words?

If no → don’t send.

---

## 6️⃣ After You Send the Email

### ⏳ Timeline:

* Day 0 → send email
* Day 5–7 → polite follow-up
* Day 14 → final follow-up (then move on)

Most replies come after follow-ups.

---

## 7️⃣ Common Mistakes (avoid these)

❌ Long life stories
❌ Saying “I’m passionate” without proof
❌ Asking for a “paid internship” immediately
❌ Copy-pasting same email everywhere
❌ Not having projects ready

---

## 8️⃣ Reality Check (important)

Startups don’t care about:

* Your GPA
* Your college name
* Certificates

They care about:

* Can you **do the work**
* Can you **learn fast**
* Can you **add value quickly**

---

If you want, next I can:

* Help you **identify your strongest skill angle**
* Review your **projects list**
* Draft a **perfect cold email template**
* Create a **company research checklist PDF**

Just tell me 👍
